FLETCH16
========

This is a tiny implementation of the Fletcher16 checksum for files. It is designed to be able to be run from the DOS
command line, since I need to be able to verify file integrity on a circa 1995 laptop that I'm currently trying to
get set up.

`build/build.bat` was set up to allow this program to be compiled on FreDOS using the DJGPP compiler. It should be
compilable on pretty much any other platform for which a C compiler exists, but you'll have to execute the command
line yourself.
